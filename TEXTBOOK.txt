Textbooks should be replaced by computers and online resources.

In today's digital world, it's more important than ever for students to have access to computers and online resources in the classroom. 
While textbooks are still widely used, they are slowly being replaced by digital resources.
 Here are three reasons why computers and online resources are better than textbooks:

1. They're more engaging.

 Computers and online resources are more engaging than textbooks. They can capture students' 
attention with interactive features and multimedia content.

2. They're more up-to-date.

Textbooks are updated every few years, but computer software and online resources are updated much more frequently. 
This means that students have access to the most up-to-date information.

3. They're more flexible.

Computers and online resources are more flexible than textbooks. They can be customized to meet the individual needs of each student.

Overall, computers and online resources are more beneficial than textbooks. They're more engaging, up-to-date, and flexible. 
As more and more resources become available online, it's likely that textbooks will become obsolete.
